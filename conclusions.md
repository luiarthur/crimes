# Conclusions

This analysis studies the relationship between offenders in mass-shootings in
the US (between 1982 and 2018) and their prior history (signs) of mental
illnesses.

Using a (Bayesian) logistic regression, a model was fit to data provided by
[Mother Jones' Investigation][1]. The response is whether the offender
purchased his weapons for the shooting legally (Y/N). The predictor is
whether the offender had prior signs of mental illness. An intercept term
is added to the predictor to account for bias.

The conclusion is that the difference in proportion of legal gun-purchases by
someone with prior signs of mental health issues is 17% (-0.4%, 34.5%) higher
than that of someone with no prior signs of mental health issues.

Possible implications are that a stronger vetting process needs to be
implemented to check for signs of mental health issues before vendors issue
fire-arms. Perhaps if those with prior mental health issues were identified and
refused fire-arms, 17% of the shootings could have been prevented.
