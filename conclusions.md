# Conclusions

This analysis studies the relationship between offenders in mass-shootings in
the US (between 1982 and 2018) and their prior history (signs) of mental
illnesses.

Using a (Bayesian) logistic regression, a model was fit to data provided by
[Mother Jones' Investigation][1]. The response is whether the offender
purchased his weapons for the shooting legally (Y/N). The predictor is whether
the offender had prior signs of mental illness(Y/N). An intercept term is added
to the predictor to account for bias.

Results from the analysis show that of the offenders that were mentally ill,
79% legally purchased the firearms used in their assaults. Of the offenders
that were not mentally ill, 63% of them legally purchased their firearms.
The proportion of firearms legally purchased by those who are ill is greater
than that of those who are not ill (with 96% probability).

Of the offenders in the mass-shootings, the proportion of legal gun-purchases
by someone with prior signs of mental health issues is 17% (-0.4%, 34.5%)
higher than that of someone with no prior signs of mental health issues. In
other words, guns were sold to the offenders with histories of mental illnesses
at least as often as those without.
